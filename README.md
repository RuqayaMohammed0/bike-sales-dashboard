# 🚲 BIKE SALES DASHBOARD – EXCEL PROJECT

## 📌 PROJECT OVERVIEW

This is my first Excel dashboard project, where I analyzed a customer dataset to understand patterns in bike purchases. I focused on visualizing key metrics like purchase rate, income trends, and customer segments (age, gender, region, marital status, etc.).  

The dashboard includes:
- A clean data structure
- Custom KPIs
- Interactive slicers
- Clear visualizations built using pivot tables

## ⚒️ TOOLS & TECHNIQUES USED

- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Slicers
- Basic Excel formulas (COUNTIF, COUNTA, IF, nested IFs)
- Manual data cleaning and transformations

## 🧹 DATA CLEANING STEPS

I performed several cleaning steps manually before building the dashboard:

1. ✅ Replaced abbreviations:
   - "M" and "F" replaced with "Male" and "Female"
   - "S" and "M" in marital status replaced with "Single" and "Married"

2. ✅ Fixed commute distance values:
   - Changed "10+ miles" to "More than 10 miles" to prevent pivot table sorting issues

3. ✅ Created a new Age Bracket column using nested IF formulas to group customers by age range for better visualization 

4. ✅ Reformatted the Income column for cleaner numerical formatting
